Fix timestamp into a nicer format http://almosteffortless.com//2007/07/29/the-perfect-timestamp/
Maybe separate date and time
Make number of articles cut off and go on to next page
Have a name associated with each comment
Write code so that categories that are being used by articles cannot be deleted...or just have all articles from the deleted category be re-categorized as "uncategorized"
Change "Publishing" a little so that if an already-published article is being edited, users cannot see saved changes until the person re-publishes?
Add error checking
See how picture looks in "about me" section

Add formatting for the user when they write posts
